Forever wild"UPPER MANHATTAN,A,Marcus Garvey Park,06,"I saw the oldest and noblest struggle of all living things ‰ÛÓ all that live in a caste system, a hierarchy, a food chain ‰ÛÓ the rage of the oppressed majority backed into a corner by their tyrannical overlords. Two trees, two humble villages, two legions of squirrels, unwilling to yield to the fearsome, pompous hawk. Some stayed in the safety of the trunk, screaming warning and encouragement to those who, fed up with the order of the world and drawing their proverbial line in the sand, led creeping assaults on their antagonizer. One by one, they scuttled ever closer, tempting fate and their reflexes, some waiting until the raptor flashed its talons before scampering back out of reach. They came from the trunk. They came from the outer branches. They clung, upside down, inches from its head, as if re-enacting a scene from ""Mission: Impossible"" they were misremembering. Can you blame them?"CENTRAL MANHATTAN,B,Madison Square Park,07,"It was an interesting experience watching/observing the antics of the squirrels and noting how many people react positively to seeing them. They are real crowd-pleasers, and almost everyone who sees them foraging or running or even just sitting gets a smile on their face. Unfortunately, a few dog owners encourage their dogs to chase them, and this is not a positive thing to watch."CENTRAL MANHATTAN,B,Union Square Park,08,"I had an extremely bizarre and interesting thing happened with squirrels in Central Park and wrote a song entitled ‰ÛÏSquirrel Peril.‰Ûù The squirrels were the heroes. I would love for you folks to hear it. If it would be of any use to the ‰ÛÏsquirrel cause,‰Ûù I‰Ûªd be thrilled. Let me know if you‰Ûªd like to hear it. It would only take five minutes. I‰Ûªll sing it over the phone for you. It‰Ûªs a great song ‰ÛÓ really fun."CENTRAL MANHATTAN,B,Stuyvesant Square Park,09,We didn‰Ûªt know that there were black color morphs in Stu Park! They did look more brown/red and black than the totally black color morphs but it was still very exciting to see them. A lot of the squirrels also seemed to expect food when we approached them. There were also lots of rat poison boxes around the park.CENTRAL MANHATTAN,B,Washington Square Park,10,"Total spotted: 51

Lindsay East River Park,12,"Squirrels tend to be located by the largest trees in the middle of the park and away from the paths on both sides, and the ball pitches.

There were a few younger squirrels playing in a fenced off park storage area with some broken solar panel trash compactors/cans."LOWER MANHATTAN,C,Sara D. Roosevelt Park (Section Above Delancey St),13.1,"Sara D. Roosevelt Park (Section Above Delancey St):

Unfortunately, we were unable to find squirrels‰Û_

There are some reasons why we were unable to find squirrels as below.

1) Still cold!
2) Too much traffic‰Û_
3) Tree was not comfortable for squirrels. No nest!
4) Most of ground is covered in pavement and there is little room for squirrels to stay.

Sad!!"LOWER MANHATTAN,C,Seward Park,14,"Lots of people for a cold winter day! People playing basketball, eating soup (homemade), working out. Squirrels seem to be thriving. We saw two pals on the J train down sharing headphones and wearing interesting outfits (one, a mesh top; the other, an alien-logo hat, an acid-wash jean trenchcoat, and SpongeBob socks). At the park, a dad played volleyball with his three children, a woman taught her son to ride a bike, and another woman ate a noodle lunch from a glass jar.

We set out from Battery Park on our adventure. Stopped for coffee on Wall Street, no late-stage capitalistic squirrels around. After a quick ride on the FDR and hitting the Grand Canyon of potholes, we arrived at Corlears Hook. Immediately upon exiting our cab, we found ourselves in the middle of a scurry of content, active squirrels. Unsure of who was more overwhelmed (them or us), we quickly began recording observations. Shirtless calisthenics, tag-playing squirrels, and a particularly curious squirrel that we dubbed Gerald were just a few things we encountered during our outing. Playful pooches and lounging lovers brightened the surroundings as we observed the multitude of New York‰Ûªs cutest rodent inhabitants."LOWER MANHATTAN,C,Columbus Park,16,"Quintessential NYC ‰ÛÒ bustling park

Possible reason for lack of squirrels:
- permafrost or soil too densely packed
- too many children and/or dogs
- not enough litter or BBQs
- scary noises from skateboarders
- can‰Ûªt afford rent in Williamsburg
- on vacation, visiting cousins in Florida
- huge, empty open space with no trees
- scared of the citizenship question on the census
- climate change
- big pigeon ate the squirrels"BROOKLYN,D,Sternberg Park,24,Homeless woman at top of stairs of Broadway station (G); people playing basketball; one tree on corner of Boerum and Montrose with a ton of pigeons; empty dog park; one guy working out; a few kids playing.
